The Resistor Memory-based Graph Neural Network (RGNN) is designed for modeling ion and electron interaction systems. It is evaluated in computational tasks such as atomic force, Hamiltonian, and ground state many-body wave function calculations. Building on the literature of GNNs, the programming randomness of resistive memory is utilized, employing reservoir MP layers to update node and edge embeddings. In the reservoir MP layers, matrix-vector multiplications are performed using random weights derived from resistive memory.

In terms of software implementation, we provide conductivity data from resistive memory chips, which can be used for training and testing the RGNN model. During the training process, the parameters of the reservoir MP layers do not require training, and only a small fraction of weights (<10%) need to be optimized. Therefore, compared to conventional GNNs, the training complexity is significantly reduced.

In accordance with the characteristics of hybrid analogue-digital systems, we added a quantization module to convert analog data into multi-bit binary vectors. Moreover, based on the conductance fluctuations of resistive memory chips, we set corresponding Gaussian noise, which was added to the random weights of reservoir MP layers for testing.

The code provided here offers a comprehensive resistance memory-based simulator, where the multibit vector-matrix multiplication of reservoir MP layers can be implemented using resistive memory chips.

Atomic force: We have provided a simple way to train the RGNN and evaluate the model. You can configure the PyTorch environment by referring to the requirements in Reference 1 (GNNFF). We have prepared the graph data from the amorphous LiPO and you can start the model training directly according to the guidance. Finally, the trained model and the ASE software package can be used to simulate molecular dynamics.

Hamiltonian: We have provided a simple way to train and evaluate the RGNN. You can configure the PyTorch environment by referring to the requirements in Reference 2 (DeepH). We have prepared the graph data from the graphene dataset, and you can start the model training directly according to the guidance. Finally, the trained model and the OpenMX software package can be used to calculate the energy band.

Wavefunction: We have provided a simple way to train and evaluate the RGNN. You can configure the JAX environment by referring to the requirements in Reference 3 (Ferminet). Our experiment is based on the H2 molecule.
